Initial entry:
	I have stopped working on my MADN Project because it went over my head.
	It was just too complex for a beginner Project, so I started a basic and simple one.
	The most simple I could come up with was Mau Mau, so here I am.
	
	I wanted to build it up from the ground and so I thougt best would be to start with the data structures.

	Mau mau has a deck of cards, 2 players with and cards, one human and one PC player. And one deck for cards that have been put down.

	A deck contains cards with numbers from 2 to 10, and in order jack, queen, king, ace, as well as 4 different colors, namely cross, heart, spades, clubs.

	These cards need to be mixed and sorted into the deck. These cards are 8+4*4, so 32 in total. 

	The Handcards are to be handed out as 7 each player.

Second entry:
	Okay, so the whole thing is running just fine, but it is not clean code, I want to polish it a litte by applying the MVC pattern to it and add a GUI Later.
	It would be pretty amazing to have a networking function as well later on. But who knows.
		To Make it more polished I need to make the folders, add the __init__.py files, put the classes in their files and untie the knot a little
	by adding moving some functions in their appropriat modules.
