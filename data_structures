Cards:
1 number 1-12 integer
1 color 1-4 integer

deck
0-32 Cards

Hands
0-7 Cards

The Cards need to have a dedicated class structure. They need a constructor. But no functions except maybe getters but as I will write it in Pyhton no getters are needed.

The Deck needs a Constructor and a shuffle and restock method.

There has to be Game class which acts as a manager class for the whole game.
